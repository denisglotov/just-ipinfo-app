Just IP Info is a minimalistic, Android application that fetches IP information.

Features:
- Request IP Info: Fetches JSON data from ipinfo.io via GET request.
- Persistent Logging: Saves every request result (or error) with a timestamp to an internal log file.
- Log Management: Immediate visibility of logs in the UI with a "Clear" function.
